Java-API-to-mtgdb
=================

A Java API to access the web services provided by mtgdb.info.

If you are interested in just using the API, feel free to just download the jar and add it to your classpath appropriately.

Another option is to grab the whole repsoitory and reference it when building your project.

I've tested the individual methods, but I haven't tried to integrate this into another project yet, so if you have any hiccups, just let me know.
